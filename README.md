## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Currently based in Buenos Aires, Argentina. 
I'm an Informatic Engineer from the University of Buenos Aires (UBA for short) who currently works as a Solution Architect/Cloud Engineer @ Pan American Energy. 
I specialize in AWS and I know just enought to talk about most services it as if I really understand what I'm saying. But I also mostly end up in Troubleshooting Hell.

I also really like learning about Systems as a whole, a little bit of what I'm doing/what I've done:

- [Bitcoinlib](https://github.com/franciscoJpereira/bitcoinlib)
- Just reading and doing the exercises from [OSTEP](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/)
- Keeping sharp on [Discrete Mathematics](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-8176-8286-6)

Appart from computer science/engineering stuff I'm an avid city walker and a souls-like games fan.
